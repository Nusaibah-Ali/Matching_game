This game is about matching 8 pairs of cards, if the user guesses the identical
cards correctly the user wins the game.
when the user starts the game the timmer will start and each move is counted.
if the user finishes the game with less moves he wins with more stars.
if he reaches 16 moves he loses one star and he loses the other one
when he reaches 24 moves.
when the user wins a modal appears with a congratulation message, a game stats, and restart button .

, the moves, and stars to their default values.
